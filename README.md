# raspiblitz_openvpn
Scripts to install and configure a clean Ubuntu 20.04 VPS as an OpenVPN gateway for Raspiblitz and install the client certificate.

## Assumptions, Warnings, Notes, Misc.
1. These scripts were developed and tested using a brand new Ubunutu 20.04 Server VPS. 
    1. If you run these scripts on a server that is already configured, there's no telling what you might break.
    2. If you use any other version of Linux, you are in uncharted territory.
2. This assumes your Raspiblitz is installed, configured, and confirmed to be working before you try to connect it to a VPN. Otherwise if you have any problems, you will not know if it's the VPN connection or your Raspiblitz configuration.
3. Recommended hosting providers:
    1. The first time I set up an OpenVPN server, I used a guide published by DigitalOcean.com. I've since converted their instructions to my own set of scripts and procedures, so there's no plagiarism here. But since they helped me and now I'm helping you, it might be cool if you got one of their lowest tier droplets to run your VPN.
    2. I also am a fan of Linode.
    3. And there are many others to choose from.



Default network interface is eth0
